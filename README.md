Hi there! I'm Ashley, a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in cyber security, currently working as an English teacher in South Korea. While teaching abroad, I've been able to expand my skill set and broaden my perspective, and I’m excited to transition back into the tech field when I return to the U.S.

My journey in computer science sparked my passion for cybersecurity, where I've honed my skills in network security, ethical hacking, and data protection. I’m excited about finding innovative ways to protect digital infrastructures and ensure privacy in an increasingly interconnected world. As I look to the future, my goal is to join one of the Big 4 companies as a data analyst.
